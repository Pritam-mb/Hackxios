## 🌍 EcoSync — Connecting Communities, One Item at a Time

**EcoSync** is a hyperlocal peer-to-peer marketplace designed to revolutionize how neighbors share resources. We believe that the items gathering dust in your closet could be treasures for someone down the street. By enabling lending, borrowing, renting, and auctioning within local communities, we're building a more sustainable and connected world.

## 🎯 Mission Snapshot

| Scope | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Core Experience | Map-based hyperlocal marketplace for lending, borrowing, and renting items |
| Tech Stack | React · Node.js · Express · MongoDB · Leaflet Maps · JWT Auth |
| Vision | Reduce waste, build trust, and strengthen community bonds through resource sharing |
| Status | Full-stack MVP with authentication, map discovery, and transaction management |

## 👀 Our Story • Building a Sustainable Future

The journey of **EcoSync** began with a simple observation: most households are filled with items that are rarely used—power tools, kitchen appliances, camping gear, and more. Meanwhile, neighbors are buying these same items, leading to unnecessary consumption and waste. We envisioned a platform where communities could share resources efficiently, building trust while reducing environmental impact.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlTy9x8FZo0XO1i/giphy.gif" width="460" alt="Community sharing concept" />
</div>

From concept to code, we built **EcoSync** as a full-stack solution that combines intuitive map-based discovery with robust transaction management. Users can browse items on an interactive map, filter by category and distance, and manage lending or borrowing requests with complete transparency. Every feature is designed to make sharing as effortless as possible.

### 🌟 Key Achievements

- **Seamless Authentication** — JWT-based secure login with user profiles and trust scores
- **Interactive Map Discovery** — Leaflet-powered map showing available items in your neighborhood  
- **Smart Filtering** — Category-based search (Tools, Kitchen, Electronics) with distance parameters
- **Transaction Flow** — Complete request and approval system for borrowing/renting items
- **Mobile-First Design** — Responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- **Real-Time Updates** — Dynamic item availability and request status tracking

## 🎓 The EcoSync Philosophy

**EcoSync** is more than a marketplace—it's a movement toward sustainable living. By facilitating resource sharing at the neighborhood level, we're addressing three critical challenges:

1. **Environmental Impact** — Reducing consumption and waste through shared ownership
2. **Community Connection** — Rebuilding trust and relationships in local neighborhoods  
3. **Economic Efficiency** — Enabling access over ownership, saving money for everyone

Every transaction on **EcoSync** represents a small victory for sustainability and community building.
